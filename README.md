# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my background, skills, projects, and ways to get in touch. It’s built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, and can be easily hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Home Page:** A hero section featuring a profile image and a quick introduction.
- **About Page:** Background information, a short bio, and a downloadable resume.
- **Projects Page:** A grid of project cards with descriptions and links to detailed project pages.
- **Skills Page:** A visually organized list of technical and non-technical skills.
- **Contact Page:** A working contact form (client-side) and social links.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (including Flex and Grid layouts)
- JavaScript for form handling and interactions
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography

No backend frameworks or databases are included—this is a static site.
